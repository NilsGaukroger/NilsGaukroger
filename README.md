## Hi there! 👋

- 🌬️ I’m currently working on analytical wake models for wind energy at [DTU Wind and Energy Systems](https://wind.dtu.dk).
- 🐍 I write almost exclusively in **Python**, with a focus on **scientific programming**.
- 📊 I’m developing my own analytical wake model, which will be published on **PyWake** before September 2025.
- 💼 I also enjoy writing Python code to manage personal finances, tailored for expats.
- 🚀 My goal: turn **research papers** into **high-quality code** to make a real impact in industry.
